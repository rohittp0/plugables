# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A multi-plugin Gradle repository publishing standalone Gradle plugins under the group `com.rohittp.plugables`. Published to GitHub Packages at `https://maven.pkg.github.com/rohittp0/plugables`.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Build all plugins
./gradlew build

# Build a specific plugin
./gradlew :<plugin-name>:build

# Run tests for all plugins
./gradlew test

# Run tests for a specific plugin
./gradlew :<plugin-name>:test

# Run a single test class
./gradlew :<plugin-name>:test --tests "com.rohittp.plugables.<plugin-name>.<TestClass>"

# Publish a plugin to GitHub Packages (requires GITHUB_ACTOR and GITHUB_TOKEN env vars)
./gradlew :<plugin-name>:publish

# Publish all plugins
./gradlew publish
```

## Architecture

The root project applies shared config only — no plugin logic lives at the root. Each plugin is a fully self-contained subproject with its own `build.gradle.kts` and versioning.

**Plugin structure (per subproject):**
- `<Name>Plugin.kt` — implements `Plugin<Project>`, calls `extensions.create(...)` then `tasks.register(...)`
- `<Name>Extension.kt` — abstract class with `@Inject constructor(objects: ObjectFactory)` for DSL configuration
- Task files — one class per task, registered in the plugin class

**Plugin ID pattern:** `com.rohittp.plugables.<plugin-name>`  
**Implementation class pattern:** `com.rohittp.plugables.<plugin-name>.<Name>Plugin`

## Adding a New Plugin

1. Create `<plugin-name>/` directory with `build.gradle.kts` and `src/main/kotlin/com/rohittp/plugables/<plugin-name>/`
2. Add `include(":<plugin-name>")` to `settings.gradle.kts`
3. Implement Plugin, Extension, and task classes following the patterns above
4. Set `version = "x.y.z"` in the subproject's `build.gradle.kts`

## Key Conventions

- JVM target: 21 (set via `kotlin { compilerOptions { jvmTarget.set(JvmTarget.JVM_21) } }`)
- Each plugin sets its own version in its `build.gradle.kts`; root project never sets plugin versions
- Repositories (`google()`, `mavenCentral()`) are configured in root `subprojects {}` block — do not redeclare them in subprojects
- Publishing credentials come exclusively from `GITHUB_ACTOR` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variables

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **plugables** (210 symbols, 478 relationships, 11 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## When Debugging

1. `gitnexus_query({query: "<error or symptom>"})` — find execution flows related to the issue
2. `gitnexus_context({name: "<suspect function>"})` — see all callers, callees, and process participation
3. `READ gitnexus://repo/plugables/process/{processName}` — trace the full execution flow step by step
4. For regressions: `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` — see what your branch changed

## When Refactoring

- **Renaming**: MUST use `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` first. Review the preview — graph edits are safe, text_search edits need manual review. Then run with `dry_run: false`.
- **Extracting/Splitting**: MUST run `gitnexus_context({name: "target"})` to see all incoming/outgoing refs, then `gitnexus_impact({target: "target", direction: "upstream"})` to find all external callers before moving code.
- After any refactor: run `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "all"})` to verify only expected files changed.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Tools Quick Reference

| Tool | When to use | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `query` | Find code by concept | `gitnexus_query({query: "auth validation"})` |
| `context` | 360-degree view of one symbol | `gitnexus_context({name: "validateUser"})` |
| `impact` | Blast radius before editing | `gitnexus_impact({target: "X", direction: "upstream"})` |
| `detect_changes` | Pre-commit scope check | `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "staged"})` |
| `rename` | Safe multi-file rename | `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` |
| `cypher` | Custom graph queries | `gitnexus_cypher({query: "MATCH ..."})` |

## Impact Risk Levels

| Depth | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| d=1 | WILL BREAK — direct callers/importers | MUST update these |
| d=2 | LIKELY AFFECTED — indirect deps | Should test |
| d=3 | MAY NEED TESTING — transitive | Test if critical path |

## Resources

| Resource | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `gitnexus://repo/plugables/context` | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/plugables/clusters` | All functional areas |
| `gitnexus://repo/plugables/processes` | All execution flows |
| `gitnexus://repo/plugables/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace |

## Self-Check Before Finishing

Before completing any code modification task, verify:
1. `gitnexus_impact` was run for all modified symbols
2. No HIGH/CRITICAL risk warnings were ignored
3. `gitnexus_detect_changes()` confirms changes match expected scope
4. All d=1 (WILL BREAK) dependents were updated

## Keeping the Index Fresh

After committing code changes, the GitNexus index becomes stale. Re-run analyze to update it:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

If the index previously included embeddings, preserve them by adding `--embeddings`:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze --embeddings
```

To check whether embeddings exist, inspect `.gitnexus/meta.json` — the `stats.embeddings` field shows the count (0 means no embeddings). **Running analyze without `--embeddings` will delete any previously generated embeddings.**

> Claude Code users: A PostToolUse hook handles this automatically after `git commit` and `git merge`.
